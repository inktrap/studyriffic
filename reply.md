In general I guess something must have been wrong with my PDF viewer, because
I had only a view orange notes. You found so many improvements because I did
not realize how many tasks and questions changed (I thought that only stuff
that was explicitly marked changed).

I read through all of your findings after I did the corrections to make sure
everything is correct now. I hope the tasks won't change again. :) However,
I guess it would be better if we would change the tasks directly in the json file and
generate the tex from that. That way we would guarantee that they read the same.
(However for this study I think we don't need to consider this.)

To answer your question about randomization: Yes, this constraint is still in
place.

> (*) A question about randomization: is the constraint "No three fillers after each other" still in place? Or did we not have any constraint like it (because only low-level labels can be accessed, like "Good" or "Bad")? It's not that important, if it's not in place.
