<h1 id="a-user-guide-to-studyriffic">A user guide to Studyriffic</h1>
<p>“Or: I am getting <code>AssertionError</code>s, how does this thing work?”</p>
<p>Studyriffic is a simple tool to create and host multiple studies, especially on <a href="">prolific</a>. This is the <a href="">user guide</a>, but <a href="">developers</a> should read it as well, because I am going to explain the ideas and concepts while I create our first study. Let’s start!</p>
<h1 id="create-a-new-study">Create a new study</h1>
<p>Basicly what you are doing is always the same. Studyriffic is run by convention over configuration and therefore some files are pretty important. You should probably now what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">json</a> is. Let’s assume you do. Let’s assume further your are interested in <a href="">owls</a> and you would like to ask people questions about owls.</p>
<p>The first thing you have to do, is to create a folder, like this: <code>ROOT/studies/owls</code>. This folder gives your study it’s name and will contain the settings and tasks files.</p>
<h1 id="settings">Settings</h1>
<p>Our settings are living in a file called <code>settings.json</code> in the folder we just created.</p>
<p>A settings file looks like the example below, and the keys that are described below are mandatory. Studyriffic is checking this pretty strictly, so you probably will get a lot of complaints (which is a good thing!).</p>
<p>Json does not allow comments, so you probably want to download the complete <a href="">settings.json</a> file without comments.</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<h1 id="tasks">Tasks</h1>
<p>Your tasks are living in a file called <code>tasks.json</code> and it also has a pretty strict format. Some values here affect <code>settings.json</code>, so they have to fit together. Again, json does not allow comments, so download the whole <a href="">tasks.json</a> file without comments.</p>
<h2 id="a-single-task">A single task</h2>
<p>A <code>tasks.json</code> file consists of a list of tasks. A single task looks like this: <sub>~</sub> { “situation”: “”, /* this is the situation. if it is non-empty (that means anything else than “”) it will be displayed first, see: situation-sentence-example. <em>/ TODO “category”: “”, /</em> the whole task has to have a category. typical categories are filler and target <em>/ “sentence”: “”, /</em> this is the sentence that the participant is going to rate/judge <em>/ “type”: “”, /</em> the whole task can have a type which acts as a fine-grained labeling that is not as broad as categories <em>/ “id”: /</em> lastly a task has to have a sequential numerical id that is unique for this tasks file */ } <sub>~</sub></p>
<h2 id="an-example-tasks-file">An example tasks file</h2>
<p>And a <code>tasks.json</code> file might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[
{
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls can hunt if it is dark.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;filler&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;It was surprising that the owl saw the mouse even if it was dark.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;hunt&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 0
}, {
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls are very good hunters.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;target&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;The owl caught the mouse and ate it.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;hunt&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 1
}
]</code></pre>
<p>So, we have two tasks, one is a filler and one a target and both are of the type <code>hunt</code>. We also have two different situations and sentences. The ids are how they should be: unique, numerical and sequential.</p>
<h2 id="a-tasks-file-that-works">A tasks file that works</h2>
<p>Typicly you have a lot of questions and this is pretty important, otherwise the task selection algorithm might not be able to produce results according to your requirements – there simply might not be enough items in each category or for each type. So, this is like the previous file, only with more tasks.</p>
<pre><code>[
{
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls can hunt if it is dark.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;filler&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;It was surprising that the owl saw the mouse even if it was dark.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;hunt&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 0
}, {
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls are very good hunters.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;target&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;The owl caught the mouse and ate it.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;hunt&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 1
},
{
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls can eat a lot of mice.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;filler&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;It was surprising that the owl did not eat the mouse.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fact&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 2
}, {
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls are not very good listeners.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;target&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;Jimmy called the owl but the owl did not listen.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fact&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 3
},
{
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls are awesome.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;filler&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;It was surprising that the owl saw the mouse even if it was dark.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fact&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 4
}, {
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls have a lot of feathers.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;target&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;The owl caught the mouse and ate it.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;hunt&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 5
},
{
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls have a lot of humor.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;filler&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;It was surprising that the owl saw the mouse even if it was dark.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;fact&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 6
}, {
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Jimmy petted an owl once.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;target&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;The owl caught the mouse and ate it.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;jimmy&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 7
},
{
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;The owl caught a mouse and brought it to Jimmy.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;filler&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;It was surprising that the owl saw the mouse even if it was dark.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;jimmy&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 8
}, {
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Jimmy is the best friend of an owl.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;target&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;The owl caught the mouse and ate it.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: &quot;jimmy&quot;,
    &quot;id&quot;: 9
}
]</code></pre>
<p>Here we have ten tasks, two categories (<code>filler, target</code>) and three types (<code>jimmy, hunt, fact</code>). This should be enough for a small study with four questions.</p>
<h2 id="inline-html-and-newlines">Inline HTML and newlines</h2>
<p>The value of a <code>&quot;sentence&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;situation&quot;</code>-key might contain a newline. As per the JSON-standard, newlines have to be written as <code>\n</code>. The newline will be transformed into an HTML-linebreak by JavaScript in the template <code>main.tpl</code>.</p>
<p>(Please note: <code>main.tpl</code> uses Jquery’s <code>html</code>-method to display the content – and therefore is vulnerable to XSS-attacks and other shenanigans. I worked with the assumption that you are creating your template (or are using mine) but you are definitely creating your own tasks and settings files, so you can trust them. That way you have the flexibility to include other inline markup, despite that this is not the preferred way of doing this.)</p>
<p>(Additional note/reminder for mysel: I still have to find out if bottle’s cookie function is vulnerable to CSRF and if my endpoints should look out for token. On the other hand: the prolifc id is stored in the cookie, which has a signature.)</p>
<h1 id="views">Views</h1>
<ul>
<li>if you want to use a custom template, create a directory that is named like your study in the views directory. Then put the template file you want to use in it. F.e.: to use a custom <code>first.tpl</code> in our owls-study, create we would have to create <code>ROOT/views/owls/first.tpl</code>. But if you forget it, don’t worry, Studyriffic will remind you with an <code>AssertionError</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="errors">Errors</h1>
<p>When I am configuring a study I don’t expect it to work immediately: “I will get a lot of errors and that is a good thing.” It is like programming in a statically typed language: The compiler will catch the biggest mistakes and you have less headaches once your stuff works. (Yes, I used – dynamically typed – Python here :)). This section is about common errors and what you have to do to fix them.</p>
<p>It is easy to catch structural things and it is harder to get the intentions right. So there are two broad categories of errors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>logical errors:</strong> mean you messed up a setting that conflicts with other settings or it might be that a setting/item/whatever has the wrong type or conflicts logically with the assumptions that I made for you and there are</p></li>
<li><p><strong>structural errors:</strong> a file or a key or a value is missing – it does not matter what – something is missing or has not the structure that I expect.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="logical">Logical</h2>
<h2 id="structural">Structural</h2>
