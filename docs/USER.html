<h1 id="a-user-guide-to-studyriffic">A user guide to Studyriffic</h1>
<p>“Or: I am getting <code>AssertionError</code>s, how does this thing work?”</p>
<p>Studyriffic is a simple tool to create and host multiple studies, especially on <a href="">prolific</a>. This is the <a href="">user guide</a> (that means: you want to setup your own instance of studyriffic), but <a href="">developers</a> and <a href="">admins</a> should read it as well, because I am going to explain the ideas and concepts while I create our first study and then we are going to collect the results. If anything goes wrong during the setup, have a look at the errors. Let’s start!</p>
<h1 id="create-a-new-study">Create a new study</h1>
<p>Basicly what you are doing is always the same. Studyriffic is run by convention over configuration and therefore some files are pretty important. You should probably now what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">json</a> is. Let’s assume you do. Let’s assume further your are interested in <a href="">owls</a> and you would like to ask people questions about owls.</p>
<p>The first thing you have to do, is to create a folder, like this: <code>ROOT/studies/owls</code>. This folder gives your study it’s name and will contain the settings and tasks files.</p>
<h2 id="settings">Settings</h2>
<p>Our settings are living in a file called <code>settings.json</code> in the folder we just created.</p>
<p>A settings file looks like the example below, and the keys that are described below are mandatory. Studyriffic is checking this pretty strictly, so you probably will get a lot of complaints (which is a good thing!).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&quot;active&quot; : true,</code> if this setting is true, his study is active</li>
<li><code>&quot;labels&quot; : false,</code> should we label the scale? scales will be labeled if this setting is active and the scale is consists of 3 or more values</li>
<li><code>&quot;question&quot;:&quot;Do you think the following sentence is “Owly” or “Not Owly” in the above situation?&quot;,</code> this is the question you would like to ask the participant</li>
<li><code>&quot;situation&quot;:&quot;Please consider the following situation:&quot;,</code> This is an (optional) situation (or context) you would like to give. If it is empty, the task is displayed differently</li>
<li><code>&quot;questions&quot;: 4,</code> the numbers of questions. Also depends on the criteria for select restrictions (or vice-versa, depends on you)</li>
<li><code>&quot;min_scale&quot;: 1,</code> minimal value of the scale (is included)</li>
<li><code>&quot;max_scale&quot;: 5,</code> maximal value of the scale (is included)</li>
<li><code>&quot;min_scale_desc&quot; : &quot;Definitely Not Owly&quot;,</code> description of the minimal value</li>
<li><code>&quot;max_scale_desc&quot; : &quot;Definitely Owly&quot;,</code> description of the maximal value</li>
<li><code>&quot;university&quot;: &quot;Great Owl University&quot;,</code> the university or affiliation that is responsible. Will be displayed in the footer</li>
<li><code>&quot;investigator&quot;: &quot;Dr. Owly Mc Owlface&quot;,</code> the name of the person responsible for the study</li>
<li><code>&quot;contact&quot; : &quot;Owly.Owlface@owl-university.owl&quot;,</code> the e-mail of the person responsible for the study</li>
<li><code>&quot;time&quot; : 5,</code> the time that you think is needed for the study. Used in the consent form</li>
<li><code>&quot;link&quot; : &quot;https://example.org&quot;,</code> the link that will appear in the end were participants are payed</li>
<li><code>&quot;actions&quot;: [&quot;select&quot;, &quot;max_successors&quot;],</code> a list of possible values for actions. If you are not adding new actions, you don’t have to change this</li>
<li><code>&quot;types&quot;:[&quot;hunt&quot;, &quot;fact&quot;, &quot;jimmy&quot;],</code> a complete list of the types that appear in your tasks file</li>
<li><code>&quot;categories&quot;:[&quot;filler&quot;, &quot;target&quot;],</code> a complete list of categories that appear in your tasks file</li>
<li><code>&quot;templates&quot;: [&quot;first.tpl&quot;],</code> the custom templates you are going to use. By default this would be the template that shows the introductions and gives examples</li>
<li><code>&quot;restrictions&quot;:[]</code> this is a list of restrictions. More on that later.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="optional-settings">Optional settings</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>excluded_pids</code> is a list of excluded pids. If you want to exclude one a few users from your study, you may want to list them here. If you want to exclude a lot of users, place a file called <code>EXCLUDED_PIDS.txt</code> in your study dir, it will be appended (internally) to this list. <code>EXCLUDED_PIDS.txt</code> has to contain one pid per line. In general it does not matter if you specify something as a number or a string or have duplicate values. In the end, every value will be turned into a string and then into a set.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="restrictions">Restrictions</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;select&quot;, &quot;category&quot;:&quot;filler&quot;, &quot;argument&quot;:0.5},</code> a select restriction that selects 50% of the tasks to be of the type “filler”</li>
<li><code>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;select&quot;, &quot;category&quot;:&quot;target&quot;, &quot;argument&quot;:0.5},</code> a select restriction that selects 50% of the tasks to be of the type “target”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> all select restrictions have to sum up to exactly 1 (100%) also you can only select tasks by category (that is what categories are for).</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;max_successors&quot;, &quot;category&quot;:&quot;filler&quot;, &quot;argument&quot;:3},</code> a sequence of three tasks of the category filler is allowed, more is forbidden</li>
<li><code>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;max_successors&quot;, &quot;category&quot;:&quot;target&quot;, &quot;argument&quot;:3},</code> a sequence of three tasks of the category target is allowed, more is forbidden</li>
<li><code>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;max_successors&quot;, &quot;type&quot;:&quot;hunt&quot;, &quot;argument&quot;:2},</code> a sequence of two tasks with the type hunt is allowed, more is forbidden</li>
<li><code>{&quot;action&quot;:&quot;max_successors&quot;, &quot;type&quot;:&quot;jimmy&quot;, &quot;argument&quot;:2}</code> a sequence of two tasks of the type jimmy is allowed, more is forbidden</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>PLEASE NOTE:</strong> if a sequence that is not allowed is recognized the sample will be drawn again that means that if you have a lot of restrictions and a very small list of tasks it might be impossible or close to impossible to find a sample that fits your requirements (and we can’t realisticly find a solution). In that case the user will be confronted with an error.</p>
<h2 id="tasks">Tasks</h2>
<p>Your tasks are living in a file called <code>tasks.json</code> and it also has a pretty strict format. Some values here affect <code>settings.json</code>, so they have to fit together. Again, json does not allow comments, so download the whole <a href="">tasks.json</a> file (which is introduced at the bottom) without comments.</p>
<h3 id="a-single-task">A single task</h3>
<p>A <code>tasks.json</code> file consists of a list of tasks. A single task looks like this: <sub>~</sub> { “situation”: “”, /* this is the situation. if it is non-empty (that means anything else than “”) it will be displayed first, see: situation-sentence-example. <em>/ TODO “category”: “”, /</em> the whole task has to have a category. typical categories are filler and target <em>/ “sentence”: “”, /</em> this is the sentence that the participant is going to rate/judge <em>/ “type”: “”, /</em> the whole task can have types which act as a fine-grained labeling that is not as broad as categories <em>/ “id”: /</em> lastly a task has to have a sequential numerical id that is unique for this tasks file */ } <sub>~</sub></p>
<h3 id="an-example-tasks-file">An example tasks file</h3>
<p>And a <code>tasks.json</code> file might look like this:</p>
<pre><code>[
{
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls can hunt if it is dark.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;filler&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;It was surprising that the owl saw the mouse even if it was dark.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: [&quot;hunt&quot;, &quot;owl&quot;],
    &quot;id&quot;: 0
}, {
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls are very good hunters.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;target&quot;,
    &quot;sentence&quot;: &quot;The owl caught the mouse and ate it.&quot;,
    &quot;type&quot;: [&quot;hunt&quot;, &quot;owl&quot;],
    &quot;id&quot;: 1
}
]</code></pre>
<p>So, we have two tasks, one is a filler and one a target and both are of the type <code>hunt</code> and <code>owl</code>. We also have two different situations and sentences. The ids are how they should be: unique, numerical and sequential.</p>
<h3 id="a-tasks-file-that-works">A tasks file that works</h3>
<p>Typicly you have a lot of questions and this is pretty important, otherwise the task selection algorithm might not be able to produce results according to your requirements – there simply might not be enough items in each category or for each type. So, this is like the previous file, only with more tasks.</p>
<pre><code>[{
    &quot;situation&quot;: &quot;Owls can hunt if it is dark.&quot;,
    &quot;category&quot;: &quot;filler&quot;,

    &quot;type&quot;: [&quot;jimmy&quot;],
    &quot;id&quot;: 9
}]
</code></pre>
<p>Here we have ten tasks, two categories (<code>filler, target</code>) and three types (<code>jimmy, hunt, fact</code>). This should be enough for a small study with four questions.</p>
<p>So set the <code>active</code> key in <code>ROOT/studies/owls/settings.xml</code> to <code>true</code>. Then run <code>./main.py</code>. The debugging output tells you to go to <code>http://127.0.0.1:63536/studies/owls/</code> to participate in the owls study.</p>
<p><strong>You should complete your study at least once yourself. Some errors that way you can be sure everything looks like it should and you get the results you like.</strong></p>
<h3 id="inline-html-and-newlines">Inline HTML and newlines</h3>
<p>The value of a <code>&quot;sentence&quot;</code> and <code>&quot;situation&quot;</code>-key might contain a newline. As per the JSON-standard, newlines have to be written as <code>\n</code>. The newline will be transformed into an HTML-linebreak by JavaScript in the template <code>main.tpl</code>.</p>
<p>(Please note: <code>main.tpl</code> uses Jquery’s <code>html</code>-method to display the content – and therefore is vulnerable to XSS-attacks and other shenanigans. I worked with the assumption that you are creating your template (or are using mine) but you are definitely creating your own tasks and settings files, so you can trust them. That way you have the flexibility to include other inline markup, despite that this is not the preferred way of doing this.)</p>
<p>(Additional note/reminder for mysel: I still have to find out if bottle’s cookie function is vulnerable to CSRF and if my endpoints should look out for token. On the other hand: the prolifc id is stored in the cookie, which has a signature.)</p>
<h2 id="views">Views</h2>
<ul>
<li>if you want to use a custom template, create a directory that is named like your study in the views directory. Then put the template file you want to use in it. F.e.: to use a custom <code>first.tpl</code> in our owls-study, create we would have to create <code>ROOT/views/owls/first.tpl</code>. But if you forget it, don’t worry, Studyriffic will remind you with an <code>AssertionError</code> (see structural errors below).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="results">Results</h1>
<p>I am going to explain how you get your results and how you can interpret the format. Then I’ll show you how you can read them with R (which is basic R knowledge but included for the sake of completeness).</p>
<h2 id="from-mongodbs-json-to-csv-that-r-can-read">From Mongodb’s JSON to CSV that R can read</h2>
<p>Results are saved on your server in MongoDB. If you used the cronjob to backup the data, you should get a json file with the results of your study. Let’s download it with scp and put it into the right results directory. For the owls study this would be: <code>ROOT/results/owls/db.json</code> where I used the same convention again: the folder is the name of the study and the results are in a file with a fixed name: <code>db.json</code>.</p>
<p>You <strong>have</strong> to use the same name that you used in <code>ROOT/studies</code>. You <strong>have</strong> to name your results <code>db.json</code>. And you have to make sure your study is well-configured, which means it has a <code>tasks.json</code> and a <code>settings.json</code> and the assumption is that those are the files <strong>that you actually used in production</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are going to run <code>results.py</code> now, it will check for all of that, except for the assumption mentioned above.</p>
<h2 id="the-csv-files">The csv files</h2>
<p><code>results.py</code> then will produce several csv files:</p>
<pre><code>ROOT/results/owls/csv/settings.csv
ROOT/results/owls/csv/demographics.csv
ROOT/results/owls/csv/tasks.csv
ROOT/results/owls/csv/results.csv</code></pre>
<p>What are they? <code>RESULTS/owls/csv/demographics.csv</code> is a file with the data from the demographics form. <code>RESULTS/owls/csv/settings.csv</code> contains the settings from the experiment. It might be important to interpret your results, because it also lists the scale you used. Secondly <code>university, investigator</code>, and <code>contact</code> might be used to automatically publish your data or results.</p>
<p>Your results file (<code>RESULTS/owls/csv/results.csv</code>) lists the results for each participant (and their prolific id) together with a task-<code>id</code> which is the same as in <code>RESULTS/owls/csv/tasks.csv</code>, the later telling you which result originated from which task.</p>
<h2 id="r">R</h2>
<p>That way you can simply copy the csv folder wherever you do your analysis. There you can read the data into R with:</p>
<pre><code>demographics = read.csv(&quot;./csv/demographics.csv&quot;)
settings = read.csv(&quot;./csv/settings.csv&quot;)
tasks = read.csv(&quot;./csv/tasks.csv&quot;)
results = read.csv(&quot;./csv/results.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Then you’ll get 4 dataframes and can easily connect the results with f.e. the actual data used in the task. And you can check what your answers actually mean by comparing <code>results.csv</code> with <code>settings.csv</code>.</p>
<h2 id="publish-your-data">Publish your data</h2>
<p>My intention is to make the step from the database to the results transparent. In addition I would reccomend using something like Sweave or Rmarkdown to make the relationship between the results and the published results transparent:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>by using your <code>settings.csv</code> file which lists the authors of the study, you (or I) can write a script to export your <code>csv</code>-files to a designated platform.</p></li>
<li><p>if you publish the <code>task.json</code>, <code>settings.json</code> and <code>db.json</code>, everyone can reproduce the csv files, because studyriffic and <code>results.py</code> is open source and (I hope) well documented. <strong>TODO:</strong> what about spam if the contact mail is included?</p></li>
<li><p>if you are using <a href="http://www.statistik.lmu.de/~leisch/Sweave/">Sweave</a> in your TeX-files or Rmarkdown, you can be sure that you are using the data from the csv files (and it is easy to check if two files are the same).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you know a better and easier way, please leave some feedback, I would love to hear about it!</p>
<h1 id="errors">Errors</h1>
<p>When I am configuring a study I don’t expect it to work immediately: “I will get a lot of errors and that is a good thing.” It is like programming in a statically typed language: The compiler will catch the biggest mistakes and you have less headaches once your stuff works. (Yes, I used – dynamically typed – Python here :)). This section is about common errors and what you have to do to fix them.</p>
<p>It is easy to catch structural things and it is harder to get the intentions right. So there are two broad categories of errors:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>logical errors:</strong> mean you messed up a setting that conflicts with other settings or it might be that a setting/item/whatever has the wrong type or conflicts logically with the assumptions that I made for you and there are</p></li>
<li><p><strong>structural errors:</strong> a file or a key or a value is missing – it does not matter what – something is missing or has not the structure that I expect.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think another error needs more explanations or is not justified, please open a <a href="">GitHub issue</a>.</p>
<h2 id="logical">Logical</h2>
<p>There are a lot more assertions, but I think I should explain at least the following ones.</p>
<h3 id="assertionerror-select-restrictions-have-to-sum-up-to-exactly-1">AssertionError: “Select restrictions have to sum up to exactly 1”</h3>
<p>Selection restrictions have to sum up to one. Otherwise I don’t know what I should select for you to get 100% of the tasks.</p>
<h3 id="assertionerror-selection-arguments-can-not-produce-items-less-than-1-f.e.-you-can-not-split-a-question-in-half.">AssertionError: “selection arguments can not produce items less than 1 (F.e.: You can not split a question in half).”</h3>
<p>This happens if your selection restrictions would split a question. The number of tasks you want to use has to be divideable without a remainder by all the select restrictions. Otherwise I would have to guess or to round and that is not something I want to do.</p>
<h3 id="assertionerror-you-want-to-take-more-questions-than-there-are-questions">AssertionError: “You want to take more questions than there are questions”</h3>
<p>The number of tasks you specified is too high. So either you should get more tasks or reduce the number of tasks you want to display (this happens via the <code>questions</code> variable in your <code>settings.json</code> file.</p>
<h3 id="assertionerror-a-task-needs-an-explicit-numerical-id-but-s-is-not-i">AssertionError: “A task needs an explicit numerical ID, but %s is not %i”</h3>
<p>Honestly, giving each task an index it would had anyway seems like a burdon. But the thing is: I don’t want to rely on implicit ids. There are two reasons for that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The tasks file might change: Maybe someone decides to update the tasks file and changes the order? That way every index would shift.</p></li>
<li><p>The second reason is that explicit indexes allow you to know immediately which task and which results are related.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And: you always can use the small script I put in the <code>ROOT/studies</code> directory, which does exactly that: <code>add_sequential_id.py</code>. It expects a list of dictionaries in json format (like a tasks list) and then inserts a key with a numerical id into each dictionary. Voilá problem solved, just check that everything worked as intended and move it into your studies folder and rename it to <code>tasks.json</code>.</p>
<h2 id="assertionerror-you-want-to-select-x-tasks-of-the-category-c-but-there-are-only-y-tasks-of-that-category">AssertionError: You want to select X tasks of the category C but there are only Y tasks of that category</h2>
<p>For a category <code>C</code> it X has must be <code>X &lt;= Y</code>. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>increase the number of tasks of category <code>C</code> or</li>
<li>change the selection or</li>
<li>use less questions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="structural">Structural</h2>
<h3 id="assertionerror-study-s-needs-the-templates-s-in-s">AssertionError: “Study %s needs the templates %s in %s”</h3>
<p>You have to create a directory named like your study in the <code>ROOT/views</code> and have to place the template file there. Which templates you have to place there is defined in your <code>settings.json</code> file, for example for the owls study that would be <code>first.tpl</code>:</p>
<pre><code>    &quot;templates&quot;: [&quot;first.tpl&quot;],</code></pre>
<h1 id="restrictions-1">Restrictions</h1>
<h1 id="special-attributes-for-tasks">Special attributes for tasks</h1>
<ul>
<li><p>tasks of the category <code>filler</code> or the category <code>check</code> have to have an attribute called <code>check</code>, which is a list. This list can contain either one (<code>[0.0]</code>) or two (<code>[0.0, 0.5]</code>) values.</p></li>
<li><p>The values are mapped to the scale and are used to check if participants gave the expected answers. F.e.: a <code>check</code> value like <code>[0.0]</code> on a scale from <code>0</code> to <code>4</code> means: The participant has to select the lowest value on the scale, in this example that would be <code>0</code>. On a scale from <code>1</code> to <code>5</code> it would be <code>1</code>. This is approach ensures that you can switch scales easily. Because the answer of an attention check that wants you to select the minimum always wants the lowest value on your scale.</p></li>
<li><p>If two values are specified, you are providing a closed interval for the answer: On a scale from <code>0</code> to <code>4</code> the check value of <code>[0.0, 0.75]</code> would include <code>0, 1, 2, 3</code>, because they are included in the 0% - 75% range of your scale.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>
<p>This behaviour might be configurable by options later.</p>
<ul>
<li>Python3.5 rounds to the next even number if the distance to two number is the same. So <code>1.5</code> becomes <code>2</code> and <code>2.5</code> becomes <code>2</code> as well, even if most people would expect the last example to be <code>3</code>. This is the default behaviour of Python3.5. See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_floating_point#Rounding_rules">IEEE Rounding Rules</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#round">round()</a>.</li>
<li>the interval is defined as closed, that means a <code>check</code> value of <code>[MIN, MAX]</code> for a value <code>VALUE</code> would be checked as: <code>MIN</code> &lt;= <code>VALUE</code> &lt;= <code>MAX</code>. The reasoning here is that you are specifying a list and a list includes the values that are specified.That is why it seemed a reasonable assumption that the user expects these values to be included.</li>
